# Curriculum Overview — Full Course Map

## Course Structure

The curriculum is organized into **9 levels** plus cross-cutting topics. Levels 1-8 are sequential (each depends on the previous). Level 9 (Ear Training) runs as a **parallel track** from Level 1 onward.

## Level Summaries

### Level 1: Foundations of Music Literacy
The absolute starting point. No prior knowledge assumed. Covers the staff, clefs, note names, accidentals, rhythm basics, simple meter, the major scale, basic intervals, and first chords. Student leaves this level able to read simple melodies and understand the chromatic pitch system.

### Level 2: Expanding Fundamentals
Builds the complete key system. All major and minor keys, the circle of fifths, compound meter, all interval qualities, all four triad types and their inversions, diatonic triads in major and minor, scale degree names, and expanded musical terminology. Student leaves able to identify and build any triad in any key.

### Level 3: Harmony Foundations
First encounter with real harmony. Seventh chords, SATB voice leading, root position and inversion part writing, cadence types, phrase structure, non-chord tones (passing, neighbor, anticipation), and harmonic rhythm. Student leaves able to analyze simple chorale-style harmony.

### Level 4: Diatonic Mastery & Chromaticism Introduction
Completes the diatonic picture and opens the door to chromaticism. All non-chord tones (suspensions, appoggiaturas, pedal points), the dominant seventh chord in depth, all diatonic seventh chords, harmonic function theory (T-PD-D-T), harmonic sequences, two-part counterpoint basics, irregular meters, and chromatic embellishment. Student leaves with mastery of diatonic harmony.

### Level 5: Chromaticism & Modulation
The chromatic expansion of tonal harmony. Secondary dominants, secondary leading-tone chords, tonicization, diatonic modulation (pivot chord), other modulation types (direct, chromatic, common-tone), mode mixture (modal borrowing), small and large musical forms, and texture. Student leaves able to analyze Classical-era harmony.

### Level 6: Chromatic Harmony (Advanced)
The most complex chromatic techniques of common-practice tonality. Neapolitan chord, augmented sixth chords (Italian, French, German), enharmonic modulation, chromatic mediants, altered dominants, late Romantic techniques, complete species counterpoint (all five species), three- and four-part counterpoint, advanced part writing, and score reading. Student leaves able to analyze Romantic-era harmony.

### Level 7: Jazz, Pop, Modal & Extended Systems
Beyond common-practice tonality. Jazz chord symbol system, extensions and alterations, ii-V-I progressions, tritone substitution, blues form, chord-scale theory, modal harmony, contemporary/pop harmony patterns, Nashville Number System, complete taxonomy of all scales (~60+) and chord types (~50+), and reharmonization. Student leaves with a comprehensive modern harmonic vocabulary.

### Level 8: Analysis, Counterpoint & Post-Tonal
The most advanced material. Fugue analysis and writing, canon and imitative forms, large form analysis (sonata, concerto, variation), orchestration awareness, introduction to post-tonal theory (pitch-class sets, twelve-tone technique), 20th-century techniques (quartal harmony, planing, polytonality, minimalism), and advanced rhythm/meter (polyrhythm, metric modulation). Student leaves with tools to analyze music from any era.

### Level 9: Ear Training & Aural Skills (Parallel Track)
Runs alongside all other levels. Pitch matching, interval recognition, scale/mode identification, chord quality identification, melodic dictation, harmonic dictation, sight singing (solfege), and contextual listening. Each sub-level corresponds to the theoretical content of the matching level.

## App Implementation Mapping

### Current Coverage (Units 1-5, 23 modules)
- Unit 1 (Building Blocks) ≈ Level 1 partial (notes, steps, intervals, thirds)
- Unit 2 (Scales and Keys) ≈ Level 1.5 + Level 2 partial (major/minor scales, key sigs, circle of 5ths)
- Unit 3 (Chords) ≈ Level 2.6 + Level 3.1 partial (triads, inversions, seventh chords)
- Unit 4 (Diatonic Harmony) ≈ Level 3.2-3.7 partial (diatonic triads, functions, Roman numerals, progressions, cadences)
- Unit 5 (Modes and Beyond) ≈ Level 7 teaser (extended chords, modes introduction)

### Gaps in Current Curriculum
- **Missing from beginner:** Notation/staff fundamentals, rhythm, meter, clefs, musical terms
- **Missing from intermediate:** Voice leading, part writing, NCTs, harmonic sequences, counterpoint
- **Missing entirely:** Secondary dominants, modulation, mode mixture, forms, Neapolitan/augmented sixths, jazz harmony, pop harmony, ear training, post-tonal theory

### Suggested Implementation Phases

**Phase 1 — Complete Beginner (Levels 1-2):** ~20 modules
Restructure existing Units 1-3. Add notation, rhythm, meter, musical terms. Fill gaps in intervals and triads.

**Phase 2 — Intermediate Foundation (Levels 3-4):** ~25 modules
Voice leading, part writing, cadences, phrases, NCTs, harmonic function, sequences. This is where the app becomes genuinely educational.

**Phase 3 — Chromatic Expansion (Levels 5-6):** ~22 modules
Secondary dominants, modulation, mode mixture, forms, Neapolitan, augmented sixths, species counterpoint. University-level content.

**Phase 4 — Advanced & Contemporary (Levels 7-8):** ~25 modules
Jazz, pop, modal harmony, complete taxonomy, fugue, post-tonal intro. Specialized and deep.

**Phase 5 — Ear Training (Level 9):** ~14 modules
Parallel track with audio exercises. Requires quiz/assessment system.
