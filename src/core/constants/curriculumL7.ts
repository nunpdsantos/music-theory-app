      title: 'The Jazz Chord Symbol System',
      explanation:
        'Jazz uses a letter-based system instead of Roman numerals. A root letter (C, D, E…) is followed by a quality indicator: maj7 (or triangle) for bright and stable, m7 (or dash) for warm and dark, 7 for dominant tension, ø7 for half-diminished instability, and o7 for fully diminished symmetry. This system is universal across jazz lead sheets and fake books. Every jazz musician must read symbols at sight — the symbol IS the chord.',

        'Extensions are chord tones beyond the seventh, built by continuing to stack thirds above the octave. The 9th is an octave plus a 2nd, the 11th is an octave plus a 4th, and the 13th is an octave plus a 6th. A chord symbol with 13 implies the 7th, 9th, and 13th are present — the 11th is usually omitted in major and dominant chords because the natural 11th clashes with the major 3rd. Extensions vs. added tones: Cmaj9 implies a 7th; Cadd9 does not. Each extension adds harmonic richness and specificity to the voicing.',

Diminished 7th chords are the most versatile passing chords because every diminished chord is enharmonically equivalent to three others (due to symmetric construction), so they connect to multiple destinations.

        'Mode 7 of melodic minor is the altered scale, also called Super Locrian. Its formula from the root: H-W-H-W-W-W-W. It contains every possible alteration of a dominant chord: b9, #9, b5 (#11), and #5 (b13). The altered scale pairs exclusively with 7alt chords and is THE essential sound for dominant chords resolving to minor with maximum tension. The shortcut: the altered scale on any root equals the melodic minor scale starting a half step above (C altered = Db melodic minor). Locrian natural 2 (mode 6) is the standard half-diminished scale.',

The 5th mode, Phrygian dominant, is used extensively in flamenco, klezmer, and Middle Eastern music — it has a major 3rd over a Phrygian framework, creating a bright yet dark sound. The 4th mode, Dorian #4 (Ukrainian Dorian), appears in Eastern European folk traditions. The 6th mode, Lydian #2, begins with an augmented second that sounds immediately distinctive.

The diminished scale comes in two flavors: half-whole (H-W-H-W-H-W-H-W) and whole-half (W-H-W-H-W-H-W-H), with only 3 unique forms each.

Added-tone chords keep the 3rd and add a tone without implying a 7th: Cadd9 has root, 3rd, 5th, and 9th but no 7th.
