      title: 'Fugue Exposition: Voice-by-Voice Entry',
      explanation:
        'A fugue is a contrapuntal composition built from a single melodic idea (the subject). The exposition introduces each voice in turn: the first voice states the subject alone in the tonic, the second voice enters with the answer at the dominant while the first continues with a countersubject, and subsequent voices follow the same alternating pattern — subject in tonic, answer in dominant. The exposition is complete once every voice has entered. The number of voices (typically 2 to 5) defines the fugue\'s textural density and determines how many entries the exposition contains.',

      title: 'Subject, Answer, and Countersubject',
      explanation:
        'The subject is the fugue\'s main theme, stated first in the tonic. A real answer transposes the subject exactly to the dominant. A tonal answer modifies the opening interval to preserve tonal coherence — typically converting an initial tonic-to-dominant leap into a dominant-to-tonic response (a 5th becomes a 4th). Tonal answers are used when the subject prominently features scale degrees 1 and 5. The countersubject is a secondary melodic line written in invertible counterpoint so it functions correctly whether placed above or below the subject. A well-crafted countersubject complements the subject in rhythm, contour, and intervallic content.',

      explanation:
        'A double fugue combines two subjects, either presenting them together from the start or introducing each in its own exposition before combining them in a culminating section. A triple fugue uses three subjects — Bach\'s Art of Fugue and its unfinished final fugue are the supreme examples. In the combined-presentation type, both subjects appear simultaneously in the opening exposition; in the separate-exposition type, the second subject gets its own full exposition before the two subjects are woven together contrapuntally.

      explanation:
        'After the exposition, episodes — transitional passages built from motivic fragments of the subject or countersubject, often deployed in sequence — modulate to new keys for middle entries. Each episode typically takes a short motive (a few notes from the subject\'s head or tail) and sequences it through a chain of keys, creating forward momentum. Middle entries restate the subject in related keys: the relative major or minor, the subdominant, or more remote tonal areas. The alternation of episodes and entries gives the fugue its characteristic sense of departure and return.',

      title: 'Stretto: Overlapping Subject Entries',
      explanation:
        'Stretto occurs when a new entry of the subject begins before the previous one has finished, creating overlapping statements that generate contrapuntal density and climactic intensity. The tighter the stretto interval (the shorter the gap between entries), the more technically impressive and dramatically forceful the passage. Stretto is often reserved for the final section of a fugue, intensifying the return to the tonic. Not all fugue subjects are amenable to stretto — the ability to overlap depends on the subject\'s intervallic and rhythmic properties.',

Diminution uses shorter values, doubling the speed and creating urgency. Melodic inversion reverses all intervals — ascending motion becomes descending — transforming the subject\'s contour while preserving its rhythmic profile. Retrograde presents the subject backwards, though this is rare in fugues (more common in serial music). These devices can be combined: inverted augmentation, retrograde diminution.

      explanation:
        'In a strict canon, a leader voice (dux) presents a melody and a follower (comes) replicates it exactly after a fixed time delay, transposed by some interval. Canon at the unison repeats at the same pitch; canon at the octave shifts by an octave; canon at the fifth transposes up a perfect fifth. The compositional challenge is profound: the leader must generate a melody that produces valid counterpoint against a time-delayed copy of itself.

These can be combined — retrograde inversion, for instance. The round is the simplest canon: a perpetual canon at the unison where voices enter at regular intervals and the melody loops indefinitely.

Quintal harmony uses stacked fifths (inversionally equivalent to fourths). Planing moves an entire chord structure in parallel: chromatic planing transposes every note by the same number of semitones (preserving exact chord quality), while diatonic planing moves within a scale (changing quality to fit the key). Debussy\'s parallel ninth chords and Ravel\'s parallel triads exemplify planing as a structural harmonic technique, not merely a coloristic device.',

Pandiatonicism uses all notes of a diatonic scale freely, discarding functional harmonic rules — any combination is valid, producing music that sounds tonal but resists resolution.

Philip Glass\'s additive process expands patterns by adding notes incrementally: a 4-note cell becomes 5, then 6, then 8, building complexity from the simplest possible starting material. Pulse-based minimalism (La Monte Young, Terry Riley) sustains a steady rhythmic pulse while harmony evolves slowly over long time spans, transforming the listener\'s perception of time itself.',

Witold Lutoslawski developed controlled aleatory: performers choose freely within defined boundaries (pitch content fixed, rhythm free), creating passages of controlled chaos. Mobile form (Stockhausen\'s Klavierstuck XI, Boulez\'s Third Piano Sonata) lets performers play sections in any order, so each performance creates a unique formal trajectory.

Cross-rhythms layer different groupings simultaneously: 3-against-2 (three even notes in one voice against two in another), 4-against-3, or 5-against-4. The key perceptual insight is that cross-rhythms create rhythmic dissonance analogous to harmonic dissonance — the conflicting pulse streams generate tension that resolves when they realign on a shared downbeat. This principle underlies much of Chopin\'s rubato, Brahms\'s rhythmic complexity, and virtually all sub-Saharan African drumming.',

Polyrhythm layers different rhythmic groupings within a shared meter — the downbeats still align (3-against-2 within a single bar of 6/8). Polymeter layers different meters simultaneously — one voice in 3/4 against another in 4/4 — so downbeats diverge and realign only at the lowest common multiple (every 12 beats). Hemiola is a specific and historically ubiquitous cross-rhythm: two bars of triple meter (3+3) reinterpreted as three groups of duple (2+2+2), or vice versa in compound time. Hemiola pervades Handel, Brahms, and Latin American music, creating a momentary metric ambiguity that energizes cadential and transitional passages.',

Quintuplet-based modulations yield 5:4 ratios; the technique chains to traverse multiple tempos. Additive rhythms build patterns from unequal groupings — 2+2+3, 3+2+2+3 — producing asymmetric meters central to Balkan music (aksak), Bartok, Stravinsky, and progressive rock.
