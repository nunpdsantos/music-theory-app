      title: 'The Suspension Mechanism',
      explanation:
        'A suspension is a note held (tied) from the previous chord into the new chord, creating a dissonance that resolves downward by step. It has three phases: preparation (consonant note in the previous chord), suspension (the same note held over into the new chord, now dissonant, on a strong beat), and resolution (the held note moves down by step to a consonant chord tone). The dissonance on the strong beat is what gives suspensions their expressive power \u2014 the listener expects consonance and gets tension instead.',

        'Suspensions are named by the intervals they form above the bass at the moment of dissonance and resolution. The 4-3 suspension is the most common: a 4th above the bass resolves to a 3rd. The 7-6 suspension holds a 7th that resolves to a 6th \u2014 common in sequences and chains of suspensions. The 9-8 suspension holds a 9th (or 2nd an octave up) that resolves to an octave.

The bass note is held from the previous chord, forming a 2nd against an upper voice, then resolves up by step to a 3rd. It is the only standard suspension that resolves upward.

When a complete V7 resolves to I, the resulting tonic chord is often incomplete (tripled root, missing 5th) because both tendency tones must resolve correctly.
