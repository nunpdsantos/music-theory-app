        'A seventh chord adds a fourth note — a seventh above the root — to a triad. Four notes instead of three. This extra note introduces richer color and greater harmonic tension than any triad can produce. Seventh chords are the harmonic backbone of jazz, pop, and Romantic-era classical music, and understanding them unlocks an entirely new dimension of chord vocabulary.',

      explanation:
        'First inversion places the third in the bass, creating a lighter, less emphatic version of the chord. Its primary purpose is creating a smooth, stepwise bass line — the most common reason composers invert triads. Any root-position triad can be placed in first inversion for variety.

        'Second inversion places the fifth in the bass, creating an interval of a perfect fourth above the bass — historically treated as dissonant. In common-practice harmony, second inversion triads are not freely used. Four sanctioned patterns exist: the cadential 6/4 (I6/4 decorating V at a cadence), the passing 6/4 (stepwise bass between inversions), the pedal 6/4 (upper voices move over a sustained bass), and the arpeggiated 6/4 in accompaniment figures.',
