      title: 'Equal Division of the Octave',
      explanation:
        'Symmetric patterns that divide the 12 semitones equally create tonal ambiguity because no single note feels like home. Division by 2 yields the whole-tone scale (6 notes, only 2 transpositions possible). Division by 3 yields the diminished seventh chord (4 notes). Division by 4 yields the augmented triad (3 notes). These structures were exploited by Debussy, Ravel, Liszt, and Wagner to blur or dissolve key centers.',

        'In late Romantic music, chord progressions increasingly abandon functional logic (T-PD-D-T). Instead, chords connect through voice-leading proximity (each voice moves minimally), common-tone persistence (a pitch sustains across chord changes), or pure sonority logic (chords chosen for color, not function). This marks the beginning of tonality\u2019s dissolution and the road toward atonality.',
