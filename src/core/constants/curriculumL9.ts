      title: 'Pitch Matching',
      explanation:
        'The most fundamental aural skill is hearing a note and reproducing it — either by singing or finding it on an instrument. Start with single notes in the middle register (around middle C), then expand outward. Train by playing a note on the piano, then trying to find it again with your eyes closed. This builds the internal ear-to-hand connection that underpins all further ear training. The goal is not perfect pitch (which is largely innate) but reliable relative pitch — hearing a note in relation to a reference.',

        'Can you tell if a melody goes up, down, or stays the same? This is more intuitive than it sounds — but making the judgment conscious and precise is the goal. Play two notes in sequence and identify the direction. Ascending motion moves toward higher pitch; descending moves lower. Start with wide leaps (an octave apart) and gradually narrow the gap until you can detect motion by a single half step. This trains the contour perception you will need for melodic dictation later.',

        'High vs. low is always relative: a bass clarinet\'s "high" is a flute\'s "low." Register perception means identifying whether a note sits in the upper, middle, or lower range of the instrument. On the piano, the lowest octave has a booming, rumbling quality; the middle octaves sound clear and balanced; the highest octave is bright and thin. Train by playing notes across the full range and identifying which octave region they fall in without looking. This spatial hearing is essential for understanding orchestral voicings and arranging.',

      title: 'Texture Identification',
      explanation:
        'Musical texture describes how many voices are present and how they relate to each other. Monophony is a single unaccompanied line — clean and exposed, like a solo flute melody. Homophony is one melody with supporting harmony underneath — the most common texture in Western music (think a singer with guitar chords). Polyphony has multiple independent melodies happening simultaneously — dense and complex, like a Bach fugue. Homorhythm is a special case where all voices move in the same rhythm, like a chorale. Learning to hear texture is learning to hear how music is organized vertically.',

      title: 'Form by Ear',
      explanation:
        'Hearing form means tracking repetition and contrast over time. When material returns, label it "A." When new material appears, label it "B." Binary form is AB (two contrasting sections). Ternary is ABA (departure and return). Rondo alternates a recurring theme with contrasting episodes: ABACA. Verse-chorus is the pop equivalent of alternating sections. Listen for sectional boundaries — cadences, pauses, key changes, and shifts in texture or dynamics all signal formal divisions. The skill is attention span: you must hold the first section in memory to recognize its return.',

      title: 'Style Period Recognition',
      explanation:
        'Each historical era has characteristic sounds you can learn to identify. Baroque (1600-1750): continuous rhythmic motor, basso continuo, ornamental melodies, terraced dynamics (sudden loud/soft shifts). Classical (1750-1820): balanced 4- and 8-bar phrases, Alberti bass patterns, clear cadences, elegant simplicity. Romantic (1820-1900): expanded orchestras, chromatic harmony, long sweeping melodies, extreme dynamic range. Twentieth century (1900-2000): dissonance as a primary resource, new timbres, rhythmic complexity, formal experimentation. Each period builds on and reacts against the previous one.',
